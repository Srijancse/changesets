# changesets
This is library allows you to build text-based concurrent multi-user applications.

It was built with the following requirements in mind:
* intention preservation
* reversibility/invertibility (undo effect)
* convergence

This library allows you to easily create changesets and apply them on all sites of a distributed system using Operational Transformation.


Anyone interested may want to start with [Wikipedia's entry on Operational Transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation) and some [Frequently asked questions concerning OT](http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/czsun/projects/otfaq) (quite extensive).
